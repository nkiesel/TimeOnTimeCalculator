Some future improvement ideas

1. Extend "Competitor" to have a drop-down list of boats with names and ratings.  Could be stored locally using e.g. EclipseStore.
2. Add feature to download CSV file from Jibeset. Then select fleet # for the start time of "My Boat", and select fleet and then boat for competitors.
3. Integrate with YRA to allow boats to upload their finish times.
